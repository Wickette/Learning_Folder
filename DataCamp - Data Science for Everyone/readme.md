# What is Data Science

* describe the current state of an organization or process
* detect anomalous events
* diagnose the causes of events and behaviors
* predict future events (forecasting)

1. Data collection and storage
2. Data Preparation
3. Exploration and Visualization
4. Experimentation and Prediction

# Applications of Data Science

1. traditional machine learning 

2. internet of things (IoT)
    - smart watches
    - internet-connected home security systems
    - electronic toll collection systems
    - building energy management systems
    - using a physical device

3. deep learning
    - many neurons work together (mini alogrithms)
    - requires much more training data
    - used in complex problems
        - image classification
        - language learning/understanding
    - text summary and image classification

# Data Sources

**Data collection and storage**

- Company data
    - collected by companies
    - helps make data driven decisions
        - web events (events, timestamps, user info)
        - survey data (face-to-face interview, online questionnaire)
        - customer data
        - logistics data
        - financial transactions
- Open data 
    - free, open data sources
    - can be used, shared, and built-on by anyone
        - Data APIs (twitter, wikipedia, yahoo, google maps etc)
            - application programming interface
            - requested data over the internet 
        - public records
            - international organizations (world bank, UN, WTO)
            - national statistical offices (censuses, surveys)
            - government agencies (weather, environment, population)

# Data Types

Important for:
- storing the data
- visualizing/analyzing data

Quantitative data
- deals with numbers
- data can be measured

Qualitative data
- deals with descirptions
- can be observed, but not measured

Data that uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative data
- image 
- text
- geospatial
- network

# Data Storage and Retrieval

- location
    - cluster or server for storing data
    - cloud storage
- data type
    - unstructured (email, text, video and audio files, web pages, social media)
        - document database 
    - tabular data
        - relational database
- retrieval 
    - Document database (NoSQL)
    - Relational database (SQL)

# Data Pipelines
- moves data into defined stages
- automated collection and storage
    - scheduled
    - triggered by an event
- monitored with generated alerts
- necessary for big data projects
- data engineers worl to customize solutions

- (ETL) Extract Transform Load
    - Extract Data from IOT device or API
    - Transform data to make sure data stays organized
        - joining data sources into one data set
        - converting data structure to fit database schemas
        - removing irrelevant data
    - Load into storage to be used for visualization and analysis
