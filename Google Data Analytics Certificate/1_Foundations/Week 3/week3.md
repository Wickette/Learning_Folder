# Follow the Data Life Cycle

Ask, Prepare, process, analyze, share and act

## Life Cycle

starts with the right tools - Spreadsheets, databases, query languages, and data visualization software

Plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive, destroy

**Plan** - decides what data is needed, how it'll be managed, optimal outcomes, and who will be responsible for it

**Capture** - data is collected from a variety of different sources, outside resources (government records, weather etc), from a companies docs and files (usually from databases)

**Manage** - how we care for our data, how and where, its stored, tools used, actions taken to make sure it's taken care of properly

**Analyze** - used to solve problems, make business goals, and support decisions

**Archive** - storing in a place where it is still available for long-term and future reference

**Destroy** - important for protecting companies private information, and information about a companies customers, delete any copies of the data

! the data life cycle and the data analysis process are NOT the same thing, and should not be referred to interchangeably

! the data life cycle will vary from company to company, or industy or sector

# Outlining the Data Analysis Process

data life cycle vs data process

| Data Life Cycle |  | Data Analysis Process |                                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | - | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PLAN            |  | ASK                   |                                                                                                                               |
| CAPTURE         |  | PREPARE               | where data analysts collect and store data they'll use for upcoming analysis process                                          |
| MANAGE          |  | PROCESS               | data analysts find and eliminate inaccuracies (clean, transform, combine, remove outliers)                                    |
| ANALYZE         |  | ANALYZE               | use tools to transform and organize data so that you can draw useful conclusions, make predications and drive decision-making |
| ARCHIVE         |  | SHARE                 | visualization is essential for getting others to understand the datas 'story'                                                 |
| DESTROY         |  | ACT                   | where the business takes all your hard-work and puts it into action                                                           |

### ASK PHASE

- define problem to be solved, and understand stakeholder expectations
- look at current state, and define how it's different from the ideal state
- determine who the stakeholders are (manager, sponsors, sales partners, shareholders etc)
- strong communication
- 5 Why's

ASK - 'you want to ask all of the right questions at the beginning of the engagement so that you better understand what your leaders and stakeholders need form this analysis'

- what is the problem
- what is the purpose of this analysis, and what are we hoping to learn

PREPARE - 'we need to be thinking about the type of data we need in order to answer the questions that we've set out to answer based on what we learned when we asked the right questions'

PROCESS - 'this is where you get a chance to understand its structure, its quirks, its nuances, and you really get a chance to understand deeply what type of data you're going to be working with and understanding what potential that data has to answer all of your questions'

- cleaning

ANALYZE - 'this is the point where we have to take a step back and let the data speak for itself'

SHARE - 'all of this work from asking the right questions to collecting your data, to analyzing and sharing doesn't mean much of anything, if we aren't taking action on what we've just learned'

ACT - 


# The data analysis Toolbox
