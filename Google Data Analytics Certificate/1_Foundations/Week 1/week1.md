**Exploring the wonderful world of data**: Data has its own life cycle, and data analysts use an analysis process that cuts across and leverages this life cycle. In this part of the course, you will learn about the data life cycle and data analysis process. They are both relevant to your work in this program and on the job as a future data analyst. You will be introduced to applications that help guide data through the data analysis process.

**Setting up a data toolbox**: Spreadsheets, query languages, and data visualization tools are all a big part of a data analyst’s job. In this part of the course, you will learn the basic concepts to use them for data analysis. You will understand how they work through examples provided.

**Discovering data career possibilities**: All kinds of businesses value the work that data analysts do. In this part of the course, you will examine different types of businesses and the jobs and tasks that analysts do for them.

### Transforming Data into Insights

> *People analytics* is the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people who make up a company's workforce in order to gain insights to improve how the company operates.

###### CASE STUDY - Notes

Story: a company noticed there was a high turnover rate of new hires. Most new hires leaving within a year of being hired.

"how can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees"

**ASK**

- asking effective questions and collaborate with leaders and managers
  * What do you think new employees need to learn to be successful in their first year on the job?
  * Have you gathered data from new employees before? If so, may we have access to the historical data?
  * Do you believe managers with higher retention rates offer new employees something extra or unique?
  * What do you suspect is a leading cause of dissatisfaction among new employees?
  * By what percentage would you like employee retention to increase in the next fiscal year?

**PREPARE**

- building a timeline, and decided how to relar their progress to interested parties, what data is needed to achieve success
  - developed specific questions to ask about employee satisfaction (hiring, onboarding, compensation)
  - rules for who would have access to the collected data
  - finalized what specific info would be gathered and how to present the data visually

**PROCESS**

- made sure employees understoof how their data would be collected, stored, managed and protected.
- collecting and using data ethically is one of the responsibilities of data analysts
  - restrict access to data to only a few analysts
  - cleaned data - made sure it was complete, correct and relevant -certain data was aggregated and summarized (without revealing individual responses)
  - raw data was uploaded to an internal data warehouse, for additional security

**ANALYZE**

- analyzing the data to discover patterns, trends etc
- document findings no matter what the analysis found
  * Employees who experienced a long and complicated hiring process were most likely to leave the company.
  * Employees who experienced an efficient and transparent evaluation and feedback process were most likely to remain with the company.

**SHARE**

- just as analysts are careful protecting data, they need to be careful when sharing the reports
  - shared with managers who met or exceeded the min number of direct reports
  - asked managers to share the results with their teams
  - this process gave managers the opportunity to communicate the results with their teams in order to have productive team conversations about how to improve

**ACT**

- last stage is for the analysts to work with the leaders to decide how to best implement changes and take actions
  - conduct survey annually to compare results
  - standardize hiring and evaluation process

*"A data analyst is an explorer, a detective and an artist all rolled into one"* <- this quote really resonates with me

quest for inspiration

Machine learning, statistics and analytics

stats - care and rigor

machine learning - can you automate this? many times, with all accuracy

analytics - speed, explore and discover gems/insights to bring to the decision makers, working on a lot of different things

### Understanding the Data Ecosystem

> Data Ecosystem - the various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data

Hardware and software tools, the cloud (virtual database)

Data scientist vs Data analyst

> Data Scientist - creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data

> Data Analytics - the science of data
