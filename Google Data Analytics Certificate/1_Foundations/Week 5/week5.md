## Interview Tips

"Think about a time where you've used data to solve a problem, whether it's in you're professional or personal projects"

- increase professional network

"Really important to have your LinkedIn updated along with websites, like GitHub where you can showcase a lot of the data analyst projects you've done"

- prepare questions for the interviewer
  - not broad, questions about the team and the specific work

"Sometimes there is no right answer, and a lot of the times interviewers are looking to see your thought process and the way you get your solution"

"Look for the recruiter. Look for the hiring manager online. See if you can reach out to them and set up a coffee chat or send them your resume directly"
